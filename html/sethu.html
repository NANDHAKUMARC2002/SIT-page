            MEMORIES OF MY COLLEGE LIFE !!
        </h3>
        <br>
        <P>Hai all Myself Nandhakumar from the dept of csbs at sethu institute of techology,my college was good
            because I'm a lateral entry student when i entered into college first day of  my second year
            I met Thiruyogesh and i asked to him bro which classroom for csbs bro he said im also csbs come lets go to our class
            that time i dont know his name then class started that was lab session prabha mam told to  vijay & Thiruyogeshwaren teach them simple
            programs .Both are teached very well but that time im not able to understand what they are telling so i just sake my head 
            mmm! mmm! after that both are told me see youtube channels then you can understand the programs.
            After the week we went to class room and me and my brother sitted beside of thiru we are the same benchmates and after the
            week that bench was fulled when i entered to the class room so we sitted in the ravi & vivek bench that day we become a friends
            the days was gone during the lunch time thiru,ram,sunil,kawin,mathan,ravi,vivek,nirmal and me we sit & eat and sharing the foods 
            eachothers that was a beautiful days.
            And likely that semester was conducted by online so i can pass all the  subjects without online semester im not able to
            pass the semester exam.

    <br> <br><br>

    
            Then 4th semester started the days was moving slowly because that semester government announced this semester will be
            conducted through offline 2022 sunlight also very hot thiru,vivek,sunil,vivas,hari,ravi ,nirmal and me we are bus mates
            weekly 3 days we came lately to the college so suganthi mam gave punishment to all of friends and we enjoy the silly
            punishments.
            During free time we just talked 18+ contents in the classroom and also lunch time  without bad words conversation is not 
            fullfilled the college days.
